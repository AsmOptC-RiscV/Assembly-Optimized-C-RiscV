2124 cycles total.

62 from loads and stores
1836 cycles from the permutation (unrolled)

Left 226 cycles comes from the loop implementation:

2 cycles to load the 0x9e377901 constant
4 cycles to load the constants 1 2 3 24 (1, 2, 3 are used in comparisons)
-1 per round = 24 cycles
&3 per round = 24 cycles
beq 0 = 24 cycles
beq 1 = 24 cycles
beq 3 = 18 cycles
beq 2 = 12 cycles
swaps are implemented with 3 xor each. thus 6 x 12 cycles
jump = 12 cycles
2+4+24+24+24+24+18+12+(6Ã—12)+12 = 216
10 cycles left

no clue.
